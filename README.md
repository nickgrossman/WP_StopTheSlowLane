[**Main project site here!**][1]

[**See the widget in action here!**][2]


Installation instructions
-------------------------
* [**Download the project ZIP file**][3] (and then unzip it somewhere)
* Copy the "stoptheslowlane" folder into your wp-content/plugins folder (the
  folder you need to copy is _inside_ the WP_StopTheSlowLane-master folder)
* Go into your WordPress Admin and open the "Plugins" settings screen
* Click "Activate" on the #StopTheSlowLane plugin
* (optional) if you want to configure which loading animation you get, click
  the "Settings" link. All done!



Testing instructions
--------------------
The widget uses a cookie to only show once on your site. If you're testing it
and you want to always see it, (re)load the page with #ALWAYS_SHOW_SL_WIDGET in
the URL (eg: http://rubbingalcoholic.com/#ALWAYS_SHOW_SL_WIDGET)



Adding your own animations
--------------------------
More info coming soon! For now, fork this repo, work on your own improvements to
the intro animation, and be in touch.
