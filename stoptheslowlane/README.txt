#StopTheSlowLane allows people to block out their sites with a slow-loading process to protest the FCC's proposed net neutrality changes.

== Description ==

Don't Let Your Website Get Stuck in the Slow Lane

The FCC could soon let Internet providers charge websites to access a bogus "fast lane" and slow down every site that doesn't pay. Do you want a slower Internet? Neither do we. Show the world what the FCC's "slow lane" looks like, as part of an online wave of action that doesn't stop until net neutrality wins. 

#StopTheSlowLane allows people to block out their sites with a slow-loading process to protest the FCC's proposed net neutrality changes.
